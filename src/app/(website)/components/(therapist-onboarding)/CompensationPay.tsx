          <p>
            At The Ship Group, we use a tiered pay structure to ensure that our
            associate licensed therapists are compensated fairly based on the
            number of hours worked each week. Understanding this structure will
            help you anticipate your earnings and how your paycheck is
            calculated.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Assessment Rate (CCA):</span>
            For every Comprehensive Clinical Assessment (CCA) you conduct, you
            will be paid between $35 $40 per assessment, depending on your
            experience level. This will be a fixed payment per assessment,
            regardless of the number of hours worked.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Psychotherapy Session Rate:</span>
            Your rate for psychotherapy sessions is based on a tiered pay
            structure. This means that your hourly rate increases as you
            accumulate more session hours during the week. Here’s how it works:
          </p>
          <p>
            Hours Worked (per week) Rate per Billable Hour:
            <ul>

              <li>510 hours $30/hour</li>

          <p>
            <span>Assessment Rate (CCA):</span>
         For each CCA you complete, you’ll receive $35$40 based on your
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Psychotherapy Session Rate:</span>
             Your first 5 hours of psychotherapy sessions in a week will be paid at $25/hour. If you work more than 5 hours, your next hours (510 hours) will be paid at $30/hour, and so on. As you accumulate more hours, your hourly rate increases.
          </p>
          <p><span>Example:</span> <br />
        If you work 12 hours in a week: <br />
        The first 5 hours will be paid at $25/hour. <br />
        The next 5 hours (510 hours) will be paid at $30/hour. <br />
        The remaining 2 hours (1012 hours) will be paid at $35/hour. <br />
        By the end of the week, your pay will reflect the progressive rates based on how many hours you worked. <br /> <br />
        This structure allows you to earn more as you increase your session hours each week, providing a clear pathway for increased compensation based on your workload.
